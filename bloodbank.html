            <h1>Savour the culture of sharing with our Blood Bank</h1>
            <p>Infinity Hospital provides quality bloodtransfusion services with safe blood components 24/7 the 
                in-house blood bank ensures the availability of all blood types needed for inpatient treatments 
                as well as emergency cases. We procure blood from healthy donors and prepare components such as 
                packed red cell, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet concentrate. To ensure the fitness for 
                transfusion of the collected blood, we do a thorough test. These components are then used as and 
                when indicated for the targeted treatment of patients.<br>
                Our team of three dedicated, qualified pathologists constantly explore new ways and technologies 
                to keep the blood bank up-to-date. We adhere to protocols to ensure accuracy and monitor key 
                performance indicators closely to ensure consistent quality. All methodologies used for 
                preparation and testing of blood are as specified by standard textbooks and the National 
                Aids Control Organization (NACO). We meet all the requirements stated by the Drug Controller.<br>
                
                Our platelet Aphresis units are prepared using a technique that allows a donor of any blood 
                group to donate.<br>
                
                We also honour requests for units from other hospitals and nursing homes, subject to 
                availability. Actively engaging in in-house activities to spread awareness on blood donation, 
                donor motivation while overseeing the rational use of blood and its components are some of the 
                other activities of the department.<br>
