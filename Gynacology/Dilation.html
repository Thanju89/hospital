            <h1>Dilation and Curettage</h1>
            <h3>What Is Dilation and Curettage?</h3>
            <p >Part of the reason D&C surgery is outpatient is that it only involves minimal damage to actual tissues, and the uterus is accessed with no incisions made. In most cases, localized anesthetic drugs are used and general anesthesia isn’t needed, so the patient remains awake while the procedure is performed.

Essentially, a speculum is used to open the folds of the vagina, allowing access to the cervix. The cervix is then dilated—gradually pushed open with a series of rods of increasing size—which allows healthcare providers access to the inside of the uterus.1


Once the lining of the uterus can be accessed, a curette, a specialized tool, is used to scrape the tissue. This tool, shaped like a stylus with a spoon-like scraper at its end, is able to take small portions of the endometrium.2

In some cases, suction is used as a tube sucks up tissue for removal or evaluation (something sometimes called “dilation and evacuation,” or D&E). D&C surgery is generally a scheduled procedure.</p>
            

              <h3>Contraindications</h3>
            <p >
                As with any surgery, a number of existing conditions contraindicate its being employed. These include:

<p><b>Pregnancy:</b> The primary contraindication for D&C surgery is a viable pregnancy. If you are pregnant or suspect you may be, let your healthcare provider know.</p>
<p><b>Allergy: </b> Those with a known allergy to anesthetic drugs may also be placed at risk during the procedure.</p>
<p><b>Excessive bleeding problems:</b> If you have problems with excessive bleeding, this procedure may also not be safe. Make sure to let your healthcare provider know if this is the case.</p>
            </p>

            <h3>Potential Risks</h3>
            <p>Though it’s considered a minor surgery, D&C surgery is not without its risks:

                   <p><b>Heavy bleeding </b>can occur as a result of the procedure; this occurs due to unintended perforation of the uterine lining.</p>
                   <p><b>Infection</b> can occur at the site of the surgery or if the uterine lining has been perforated.</p>
                   <p><b>Asherman’s syndrome</b> is a rarer complication, in which scar tissue forms on the uterine lining when D&C is performed after a miscarriage. Though treatable, this can affect fertility and menstrual blood flow.</p>
                </p>
            <h5>Purpose of Dilation and Curettage</h5>
            <p>
              There are several health conditions that D&C takes on, and as noted, it has both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. When used for the former, it’s often part of hysteroscopy, which involves using a video camera to inspect the uterine lining. Specifically, the procedure is called for in the following cases:
            </p>
<h5>Before the Procedure</h5>
<p>
    Your provider may suggest you to take medicine such as ibuprofen 1 hour before the procedure. This may reduce pain during the procedure.
</p>

<p><b>Uterine bleeding: </b>Bleeding between periods, especially when excessive, calls for D&C for assessment and treatment. This occurs due to the formation of growths in the uterus, such as uterine polyps and fibroids, hormonal imbalances, menopause, or certain cancers, among other reasons.</p>
<p><b>Infertility testing: </b>D&C is sometimes used alongside blood tests and other assessments as part of diagnosis in cases of suspected infertility.</p>
<p><b>Cancer screening: </b>Samples of the uterine lining may be harvested using D&C for screening in cases of uterine cancer, including both endometrial cancer (that of the lining) and that of the uterus itself.</p>
  <p><b>Following miscarriage or abortion:</b> Small portions of the placenta or other gestational material may become lodged in the uterus following miscarriage or abortion. D&C can be employed to remove this material.  </p> 
    <p><b> Following vaginal birth:</b> As with miscarriage and abortion, D&C may be used as a means of removing excess placenta tissue from the uterine lining to prevent infection.</p>
      <p><b> Ending a pregnancy:</b> D&C may also be employed as part of the procedure called vacuum aspiration to perform an abortion.</p>
      <p>Notably, there are other cases that call for D&C; if believed to be beneficial, your gynecologist or obstetrician will make sure to explain why.</p>


      <h5>After the Surgery</h5>
<p>Since D&C is usually performed on an outpatient basis, most patients are able to go home within two to three hours of surgery.2 However, your stay will be longer and may even need to stretch overnight if there are complications.

  If you’ve had general anesthesia, you’ll need to be taken to a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for recovery. Here your vital signs will be monitored as you wake up.
  
  Once you’re fully awake, you may be moved to a general recovery area and be able to drink or eat snacks. You’ll also be encouraged to get up and walk around, as this helps prevent blood clots from forming.
  
  Once the medical team is sure that your condition is stable and the procedure was successful, you can go home. When you change back into your clothes, you may need to use a pad as there may be some additional bleeding. If you’ve had general anesthesia or medications to help with anxiety, make sure to have a loved one or friend drive.</p>
